            <p class="left-align first-section-text">This was the final project of the IAT 333 Interaction Design Methods course. Our goal was to integrate ourselves into an established group and to design something that can enhance their lives in some meaningful way.</p>
            <p class="left-align first-section-text">We were able to find a team of firefighters* willing to let us observe and meet with them to discuss particulars about their experiences on the job.</p>
            <p class="left-align first-section-text">For 13 weeks we met with our participant group, further refining and iterating our design focus each week. My partner and I eventually realized there was a serious lack in PTSD treatment and focused our final design towards remedying that.</p>
            
            <p class="left-align"><em>* Specifically, the Hall 11 firefighters of the Surrey Fire Service. Special thanks to Captain Glen for allowing us to work so closely with his team.</em></p>
